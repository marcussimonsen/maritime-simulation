# README

This svg parser only accepts very simple svg's, so the following ways of
creating svg are reccomended

## Using draw.io

### Drawing

Draw your coastlines using either: 

- Preexisting shapes.
- Freehand tool with the 'brush' option unticked.
  (when drawing, each time you release the mouse, you have created a new polygon
  in pygame)

### Exporting

- Export as SVG.
- Tick the 'Transparent Background' box.
- Untick every other option.
